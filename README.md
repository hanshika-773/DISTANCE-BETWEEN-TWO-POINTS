# Ex.No.3: DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Start the program.
### Step 2: Initiate the point both values to the variables.
### Step 3: Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: Store the result in a variable.
### Step 5: Print the final result.
### PROGRAM:
  ```
import math
x1, y1 = 4, 2
x2, y2 = 10, 6
distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
print(f"{distance:.2f}")
```
### OUTPUT:
